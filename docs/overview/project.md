# Project Overview

## Purpose

Define what InventoryK12 is, who it serves, and what success looks like.

## Vision

InventoryK12 provides K-12 districts with a reliable system to track assets,
custody, and operational workflows across schools.

## Problem Statement

Districts need consistent asset visibility, accountable custody history, and
clear operational processes without fragmented tooling.

## Users

- District administrators
- Campus/site administrators
- School staff
- Students and guardians (limited visibility use cases)

## In Scope

- Asset lifecycle tracking
- Assignment and custody records
- Audit and incident workflows
- Core reporting for inventory operations

## Out of Scope (Current Phase)

- Features not required for baseline inventory operations
- Non-core integrations that do not unblock core workflows

## Success Criteria

- Core workflows are reliable and auditable.
- Role-based access is enforced for sensitive actions.
- District and campus users can complete key inventory tasks end-to-end.

## Constraints

- Docker-first local development workflow
- Security-first handling of sensitive data
- Incremental architecture decisions captured in ADRs
