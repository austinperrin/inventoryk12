# ADR Directory

Use this directory for Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

## How To Add A New ADR

1. Follow `docs/standards/adr.md` for naming, status, metadata, and review rules.
2. Copy `docs/adr/template.md` to `docs/adr/NNNN-short-title.md`.
3. Keep numbering sequential from the last accepted ADR.
4. Link the new ADR from `docs/index.md` after creation.
