# Texas Controls Mapping

Map each requirement to one or more product or operational controls. Include
links to evidence locations when available.

## Draft Controls (MVP)

- TX-REQ-001: Control = data classification for student/staff/parent PII. Evidence = `docs/security/ferpa.md`, `docs/standards/security.md`
- TX-REQ-002: Control = role-based portals + least privilege enforcement. Evidence = `docs/overview/inventoryk12-blueprint.md`
- TX-REQ-003: Control = audit logging for asset assignments, admin actions. Evidence = `docs/standards/observability.md`
- TX-REQ-004: Control = retention and deletion policy definition (soft delete default). Evidence = `docs/standards/data.md`
- TX-REQ-005: Control = incident reporting workflow (loss/damage/theft). Evidence = `docs/overview/inventoryk12-blueprint.md`

## Gaps

- Add explicit evidence once implemented in code and runbooks.
- Replace placeholders with verified Texas sources.
